Welcome！

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Economics at [University of Minnesota, Twin City](https://cla.umn.edu/economics). I'm broadly interested in macroeconomics and econometrics. Before entering graduate school, I obtain my bachelor degree in economics at [Nankai University, China](https://economics.nankai.edu.cn/).
